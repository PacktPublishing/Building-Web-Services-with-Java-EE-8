# Building Web Services with Java EE 8 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Building Web Services with Java EE 8 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-web-services-java-ee-8-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788835169), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
The Java Enterprise Edition is one of the leading application programming platforms for enterprise Java development. With Java EE 8 finally released and the first application servers being available, it is time to have a closer look at how to develop modern and lightweight web services with the latest API additions and improvements.

This video course is a comprehensive guide showing you how to develop state-of-the-art RESTful web services with the latest Java EE 8 APIs. We start by giving an overview of Java EE 8 and the latest API additions and improvements. Then you will implement, build, and package your first working web service as a prototype for the remainder of the course. Then you will delve into the details of implementing synchronous RESTful web services and clients with JAX-RS. Next up, you will learn about the specifics of data binding and content marshalling using the JSON-B 1.0 and JSON-P 1.1 APIs. Then you will learn how to leverage the power of asynchronous APIs on the server- and client-side, and you will learn to use Server-Sent-Events (SSEs) for push communications. The final section will cover some advanced web service topics such as validation, JWT security, and diagnosability.

By the end of this course, you will have a thorough understanding of the Java EE 8 APIs required for lightweight web service development. Also, you will have implemented several working web services to provide you with the required practical experience.
